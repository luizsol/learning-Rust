# Learning Rust

This repository was created so I can track my progress while learning the Rust programming language through the book [The Rust programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch01-02-hello-world.html).


I will try to follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md) as much as possible.
